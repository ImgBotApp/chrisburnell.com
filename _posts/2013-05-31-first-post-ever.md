I can tell you it wasn't a completely smooth process. And it's not even like I'm new to migrating things or trying out new technologies&mdash;over the years, I've gone from static to WordPress to static, back to WordPress, back again to static for a long time, then I dabbled with Anchor CMS and finally settled most happily with Jekyll hosted not on my server.

### What is Jekyll?

> Jekyll (<http://jekyllrb.com/>) is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), which you can use to host your project's page or blog \[on\] GitHub.

### Better, Faster, Stronger

I'm not going to give you what I *think* Jekyll does because I honestly don't know it well enough to do it justice; I'm still quite new to using it, but learning quickly. What I enjoy the most about it is the flexibility and freedom I feel as a developer working with the system. Coupled with versioning using GitHub Pages, it makes for a frictionless workflow while developing the site, and even moreso when writing actual content.

That's something else I'm quite new to but thoroughly enjoying picking up: Markdown. Essentially it's a file format that is compiled into HTML, but the original contents of the file are actually very simple to both read and write, visually resembling how the content appears on the front-end.

    # This is an H1
    ### This is an H3
    > This is a blockquote
        Tabbed content becomes a code block like this one.

    This is some paragraph, and [this](http://foo.com) is a link.

<aside><p>Again, if you have any suggestions as far as the source code for the site goes, please fork [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/chrisburnell/chrisburnell.github.io) and send me a push request with your changes!</p></aside> The CSS for this latest iteration of chrisburnell.com was also a labour of love. Really being fed up with the older version of my site and having grown immensely since I pushed that update in February 2011, I started working on this design a few months ago and tinkered away at it here and there when my spare time allowed it. I did, in fact, rewrite the bulk of it twice before I got to the current state it is in.

### So, what's new in the stylesheet?

Since my last update, I started working at [Squiz](http://squiz.net) and expanded my horizons exponentially, stepping into the fast-paced role of front-end web developer at the London office. Since September of last year, I've been part of a strong team at Squiz working with gambling giant, William Hill, in migrating their expansive network of sites from their previous systems onto Matrix, an extremely powerful and flexible Content Management System. My role in the small team of developers, technical leads, account and project managers was to oversee the CSS of the migration project and ensure that we're adhering to some standards as part of making improvements during the migration.

### More than meets the eye

Enforcing strict CSS standards goes beyond keeping an eye out for <code>!important</code>s or excessively long chained selectors&mdash;the simple pitfalls to avoid. It involved also overseeing our naming conventions and architecture of both markup and CSS. Being put in charge of this monumental task, I knew I had to step up to the plate and deliver not just as part of my job, but as a member of a closely-knit team (I'll be writing on this soon!)
