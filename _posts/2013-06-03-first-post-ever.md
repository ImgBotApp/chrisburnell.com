I can tell you it wasn't a completely smooth process. And it's not even like I'm new to migrating things or trying out new technologies&mdash;over the years, I've gone from static to WordPress to static, back to WordPress, back again to static for a long time, then I dabbled with Anchor CMS and finally settled most happily with Jekyll hosted not on my server.

### What is Jekyll?
> Jekyll (<http://jekyllrb.com/>) is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), which you can use to host your project's page or blog \[on\] GitHub.
