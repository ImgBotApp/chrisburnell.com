title: A Decade in the Making
lede: This year marks ten years that I’ve been making a mess on the web. While making a mess has always been the norm for me, documenting it <em>publicly</em>, <em>irreversibly</em>, <em>for eternity</em>, might seem a little out of character.

So I’ve officially been a <dfn title="an architect or engineer whose responsibilities include the maintenance of a website">Webmaster</dfn> for a decade now.

This is a big achievement for me because it nicely sums up and boils down my sentiments towards the web. While others might be more inclined to celebrate the fruits of their labour, I’d like to celebrate the labour itself.

I feel extremely fortunate that the labour, for me, is one of perpetual love.

I still remember my feelings toward rolling one’s own website when I registered my first domain.

The control. The confidence that came with being in control. The unending horizon of creative possibilities that came with that confidence.

No longer was I just another not-yet-eclipsed star in the Geocities galaxy. More mine than any Blogger profile, I was finally part of the <q>Blogosphere</q>, whatever that meant for 18-year-old me *(very little, it turns out)*.

Looking back on my content, *my, how I’ve aged&hellip; thankfully*.

But it’s precisely that I have any content to speak of that I’m celebrating. Just do it. Just write. Just publish. A decade later, when I look back to my earliest work, it’s almost like looking into the mind of a different person. I do remember being that person, but I feel like I’ve grown a great deal since my first foray into web development.
