<h4>H4 &ndash; Proxima Nova</h4>

<p>Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness&mdash;a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.</p>

<aside>
    <p>But there <strong>was</strong> life, abroad in the land and defiant.</p>

<p><em>Down the frozen waterway toiled a string of wolfish dogs.</em></p>

<p><strong>Their bristly fur was rimed with frost.</strong></p>

<p><u>Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths, spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of their bodies and formed into crystals of frost.</u></p>

<p><s>Leather harness was on the dogs, and leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind.</s></p>

<p>The <dfn title="Wheee!!">sled</dfn> was without runners.</p>

<p>It was made of stout <abbr title="this isnâ€™t a real definition">birch-bark</abbr>, and its full surface rested on the snow.</p>

<p>The <code>front end</code> of the sled was turned up, like a scroll, in order to <code>force</code> down and under the bore of soft snow that surged like a wave before it.</p>

    <p>There were other things on the sled&mdash;blankets, an axe, and a coffee-pot and frying-pan; but prominent, occupying most of the space, was the long and narrow oblong box.</p>
