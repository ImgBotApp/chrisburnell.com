# Ravenous - [chrisburnell.com](http://chrisburnell.com)
### The source code for chrisburnell.com, powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com), and an undying love of CSS.

If you're coming here from the wonderful [Responsive Design Weekly](http://responsivedesignweekly.com), or maybe just on your own, I'm embarassed to admit my site is a bit of a mess at the moment. Wanting to try something completely new and needing to feed a powerful hunger for *git* and *markdown*, I decided to start completely afresh on my site and go with Jekyll hosted on Github Pages. As [Justin](https://twitter.com/justinavery) highlighted in the newsletter, I have been working on the design aspect of this update for a while now, but haven't had the time or the kick up the ass to get to it and get it done. What better motivation than shiny, new technology? ... So anyway, basically I migrated my domain over to Github with the barebones of a template and absolutely no content whatsoever, so please bear with whatever state you are reading this in. :)

In the past five iterations of my website (since 2006), I have always deployed the full update in a single go. This time around, having gained a lot more breadth *and* depth to my knowledge of the front-end since my last site design update in February 2011, I will develop the site live and publicly here on Github over the next few days/weeks/months/years/thisisgettingexcessive.

I will update this README as I develop the site. Please peruse the code and structure at your will, and [contact me](mailto:me@chrisburnell.com) if you have any questions, or fork [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/chrisburnell/chrisburnell.github.io) if you have something to contribute&mdash;it's greatly appreciated.
