# Ravenous - [chrisburnell.com](http://chrisburnell.com)
### The source code for chrisburnell.com, powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com), and *powerful* CSS.

In the past five iterations of my website (since 2006), I have always deployed the update at one time. This time around, having learned a lot since my last site design update in February 2011, I will develop the site live and publicly here on Github over the next few days/weeks/months/years/thisisgettingexcessive.

I will update this README as I develop the site. Please peruse the code and structure at your will, and [contact me](mailto:me@chrisburnell.com) if you have any questions, or fork [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/chrisburnell/chrisburnell.github.io) if you have something to contribute&mdash;it's greatly appreciated.
