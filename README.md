# Ravenous -- [chrisburnell.com](http://chrisburnell.com)
### The source code for chrisburnell.com, powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com), and an undying love of CSS.

In the past five iterations of my website (since 2006), I have always deployed the full update in a single go. This time around, having gained a lot more breadth *and* depth to my knowledge of the front-end since my last site design update in February 2011, I will develop the site live and publicly here on Github over the next few days/weeks/months/years/thisisgettingexcessive.

I will update this README as I develop the site. Please peruse the code and structure at your will, and [contact me](mailto:me@chrisburnell.com) if you have any questions, or fork [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/chrisburnell/chrisburnell.github.io) if you have something to contribute&mdash;it's greatly appreciated.

If any of the template tags *{{ this.stuff }}* look peculiar, it's been done in such a way that the markup is indented correctly on the front-end. And if the super-indenting bothers you, there's also a [non-super-indented version](https://github.com/chrisburnell/chrisburnell.github.io/blob/master/css/ravenous.noindent.css).
