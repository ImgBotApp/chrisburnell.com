# Notes on GATE OV DOOM

1. meta itemprop? wotszis?
2. You should define a language on your HTML tag
    <html lang="en">
3. Linking to [a JS file on another site](http://trentrichardson.com/Impromptu/jquery-impromptu.js) which isn't publicly available. What does the jQuery Impromptu thing do that you need?
4. Inline CSS: "body {background-size: 100% 100%;}"
5. Inline JS: near top of page between <script> and </script>
6. Commented out <audio> tag
7. You need a reset stylesheet to put your CSS at a base level across browsers. Use [this one](//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/normalize/2.1.0/normalize.css)
7. CSS is a bit haywire but only really in terms of structure/organisation. It looks fairly clean except some older stuff you probably don't need anymore. I've fixed some of the indentation [here](http://uploads.chrisburnell.com/marks-super-fun.css) but there aren't really any issues beyond that.
