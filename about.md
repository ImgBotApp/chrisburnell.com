I have been doing freelance work for about seven years, ranging from web design to web development to full web solutions (albeit small), but I was never really challenged on any of my early projects, and thirsted for a position in a company that shared my passion for the web.

In 2011, I moved to London to be with my girlfriend, Rachel, and after a bit of searching found a job at a small startup that did cab bookings for the city. My role here was rather miniscule as the website had actually been acquired from a foreign company and had already been translated when I arrived to help out. I did a few pieces of HTML and CSS and got my toes wet in an actual job setting, but quickly grew bored of the position and continued to search for more employment. Starting work at <a href="http://squiz.net" title="Squiz UK">Squiz</a>, I’ve now moved onto a role as <em>Web Developer</em> at <a rel="employer" href="{{ employer.url }}" title="{{ employer }}">{{ employer }}</a> as of the 16<sup>th</sup> of June, 2014, where I’m looking forward to devoting my time to perfecting and streamlining wherever possible, and brings me to my passions in web:

I’m just going to list stuff I care about: semantic code, web standards and best practices, architecture and organisation of code, useful commenting, sharing ideas, open source and collaboration, design, web typography, user experience, clean and accessible interfaces, oh, and <em>CSS</em>.
