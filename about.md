### My name is Chris Burnell, and I’m a Canadian {{ site.job_title }} living in London, England.

I have been doing freelance work for about six years, ranging from web design to web development to full web solutions (albeit small), but I was never really challenged on any of my early projects, and thirsted for a position in a company that shared my passion for the web.

In 2011, I moved to London to be with my girlfriend, Rachel, and after a bit of searching found a job at a small startup that did cab bookings for the city. My role here was rather miniscule as the website had actually been acquired from a foreign company and had already been translated when I arrived to help out. I did a few pieces of HTML and CSS and got my toes wet in an actual job setting, but quickly grew bored of the position and continued to search for more employment. A while later, I found <a href="http://squiz.net/" title="Squiz UK">Squiz</a> and have been working there since. In August I switched roles from Front-end Web Developer to User Interface Developer, which was a welcome change for me, and brings me to my passions in web:

I’m just going to list stuff I care about: semantic code, web standards and best practices, architecture and organisation of code, useful commenting, sharing ideas, open source and collaboration, design, user experience, clean and accessible interfaces, oh, and CSS.
